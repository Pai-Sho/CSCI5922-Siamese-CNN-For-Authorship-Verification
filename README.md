# Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks for Authorship Verification

This project is meant to provide a reference implementation of the siamese network architecture described [in this paper](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/801.pdf), as well as provide a novel re-organizing and pre-processing method for the [IAM handwriting dataset](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database). It was was completed as the final project for CU Boulder CSCI 5922: Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

Project Collaborators:
- Lawrence Hessburg (lawrence.hessburgiv@colorado.edu)
- Poorwa Hirve (poorwa.hirve@colorado.edu)
